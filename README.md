<h1>Eframe/Egui TODO App</h1>
A simple Todo windows native app. This repo is a personal project aimed in honing my skills in rust.
<br><br>
The app utlizes the Eframe crate for the User Interface, and Serde and Serde_Json to parse user data.
The data is stored in the computer's file system but the personalization configuration is stored
in a config.json file in the same directory as the .exe file.

<h2>Future features I plan to implement</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Custom App Icon</li>
    <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
    <li>Scalable UI</li>
</ul>
